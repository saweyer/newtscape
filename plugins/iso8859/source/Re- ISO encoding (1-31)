(SimpleMail byteProxies LF out altogether.) Could this be why some pages appear to be a single line? In line with Apple's standard practice, invalid characters are mapped to code 26/0x1A which display as the "character not in font" square. If you want to make changes you need to crack open the MPW Shell and edit UniCodes.r. The ToUnicode resource is basically an array whose index is an 8-bit ISO character. You need to Rez this (using the command conveniently provided in the Worksheet) to update the Resources file. Then you use NTK to build the package. 15K of the 21K package size is native code, which seems a little over the top. I didn't profile the code (or indeed do any timing tests) and the code2uni/uni2code funcs may be unnecessarily native. Something to check in an idle moment... Simon
