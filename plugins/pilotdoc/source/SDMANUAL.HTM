<H1>SmartDoc Manual</H1>

<H3>Read, Create, Distribute</H3>

<P>SmartDoc is a powerful application that allows you to read, create, and distribute text documents using the industry standard Doc format.</P>

<H3>Easy</H3>

<P>SmartDoc is easy to use. If you're already using the built-in applications, you can begin reading and writing right away.</P>

<H3>Advanced</H3>

<P>SmartDoc also has many advanced features: Find and replace text. Rename and reorder bookmarks. Beam and download documents.</P>


<H2>Using SmartDoc</H2>

<P>SmartDoc has two basic views: the List view and the Document view.</P>

<P>The List view displays a list of the documents that are present on your device. At a minimum, the title of the document is shown. Optionally, settings icons, the document date, or the document size may be shown by altering the Preferences. Tapping on the document title will open the document.</P>

<P>The Document view displays the current chosen document. You may read, edit, or perform other actions here.</P>


<H3>Compression</H3>

<P> The Doc format handles compressed and uncompressed text. The compression algorithm reduces memory use by 30-40% with average English language text.</P>

<P>The compression format is asymmetric. Decompression is much faster than compression. Decompression, which is used every time you view compressed text, is nearly instantaneous.</P>

<P>However, compression requires intense processing, and because of the more limited processing capabilities of your device, compression may take an extraordinary amount of time.</P>

<P>On current devices, the average time is about 6 seconds per kilobyte of uncompressed text, or about 12 kilobytes per minute.</P>

<P>Every time compressed text is displayed, it is decompressed on the fly. If it is not altered, it does not need to be recompressed. However, if it is altered, it will be recompressed and stored back in its file.</P>

<P>Because of this, it may be prudent to work with a document as uncompressed text, and before distribution, manually recompress it. This way you will avoid the decompression/recompression cycle every time you edit text.</P>


<H3>Searching</H3>

<P>SmartDoc allows two types of text searching: Through the Find menu in the List view and through the Global Find (silk-screened Find button).</P>

<P>The Find menu only searches through the current (open) document, searching sequentially through the text.</P>

<P>The Global Find searches sequentially through all documents. This could take a long time if you have many or long documents. This may be enabled or disabled through the Preferences dialog.</P>

<P>If Global Find is disabled, you may enable individual documents to be searched with Global Find (Overide Global Find). This is done through the Info dialog or through the Global icon in the List view. This allows you to search through only documents that you wish to search through, skipping others that don't need to be searched.</P>


<H3>Autoscrolling</H3>

<P>You can have SmartDoc automatically scroll the document for handless reading or for basic teleprompting-type use.</P>

<P>Tap on the triangle that represents the "Play" button and SmartDoc will begin scrolling.</P>

<P>Tap on the square that appears to stop scrolling.</P>

<P>Use the MemoPad and ToDo buttons to increase and decrease the scrolling speed respectively.</P>

<P>Press the Addresses button to pause the scrolling. Press it again to unpause.</P>

<P>Press the Dates button to stop scrolling.</P>

<P>When SmartDoc reaches the end of the document, the scrolling will automatically stop.</P>

<P>NOTE: While SmartDoc is scrolling or paused, your device will not go into sleep mode. Be aware not to leave SmartDoc scrolling or paused if you do not intend to do so, otherwise you may unintentionally use up battery power. As soon as you stop the scrolling or close the document, your device will sleep according to the system settings.</P>

<H3>System Text Edit Functions</H3>

<P>SmartDoc allows you to use the System text editing functions such as copy, paste, and undo. However, the system imposes limit to the amount of text that may be put on the clipboard. Since Doc format documents may be much larger than the working memory in your device, Select All has been changed to Select Block while working in the Document view. A block may be as large as 8k of text.</P>


<H3>NetMarks</H3>

<P>NetMarks are essentially bookmarks for Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Each NetMark consists of a name for the NetMark and an associated URL. These may be saved into a list. Later versions of SmartDoc will have more NetMark management capabilities.</P>


<H3>Installation</H3>

<P>Install the SmartDoc.prc as you would with other software by using the installation software that accompanied your device. The SmartDoc icon will appear when you tap the Application icon.</P>


<H3>Registration</H3>

<P>SmartDoc is distributed as unlockable demonstration software. For more information, please visit our web site at http://www.onetap.com/.</P>
