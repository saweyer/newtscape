I gather from what he said that you are not really keen on Macc++ programming yourself but that you might know someone who is.Basically we are interested in someone producing a Mac version of oursoftware, but we are slightly concerned the market is not big enough. Thereason is that TomeRaider is really a PDA application. The three versions wehave for handhelds are selling really well, but the version for desktopwindows is only selling quite well.What would be useful to Mac users of one of the handheld versions ofTomeRaider is a port of some of our utilities for TomeRaider file creation,and this would also be far easier to do than the full program.I dont know much about the Newton myself, I was under the impression thatApple has discontinued them? In terms of doing a version for the Newton themain difference between TomeRaider and ebook readers is that TomeRaiderfiles are split into records rather than being a single block of text.TomeRaider files are basically simple 2-field databases. TomeRaider hasbecome popular as an ebook reader but its original purpose was as a fastreference viewer. It can load a 20-meg dictionary from compact flash usingonly 200 Kb of memory on a machine with a 14 Mhz processor and if you typein the word you are looking for it will jump to that record in under asecond.Anyway, if you are interested we would be very grateful for any help oradvice.Simon.
