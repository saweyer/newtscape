I think I've found a nice one that might present you with some interesting programming challenges.As you know, a lot of development work is now underway to come up with new ebook formats - there's the Microsoft Reader, Glassbook, the Rocket, and a couple other ones whose names escape me. The most promising format I've encountered to date is called the "TomeRaider" format. What sets this format apart from other formats is its cross-platform capabilities. The same TomeReader file can be read on an EPOC machine, a Palm, a PocketPC and a Windows desktop. It's great to be able to open and read the same data on a variety of machines without having to worry about any conversions!TomeRaider - to be fully cross-platform - currently has two glaring omissions: there's no Mac version, and the files can't be viewed on the Newton.I mentioned this to Simon at TomeRaider, and he wrote:"We are really keen to promote TomeRaider as a cross platform ebook and reference reader. I agree a Mac version would be a good idea. When we say cross platform what we have been meaning is handheld machines, but certainly a Mac version would be useful. The problem is that we have no Mac programmers working for us! We are not a giant company, and the programming tools and equipment we have are for Windows/WindowsCE/EPOC/Palm. We are however looking into the best way to get a Mac version of TomeRaider available."This of course made me think of you, with your interest in ebooks, Mac programming expertise and the success you had making the plug-in for Newt's Cape that made it possible for users to read files in Palm DOC format on their Newtons. Maybe such a plug-in would be possible to view files in TomeRaider format on the Newton? And although I'm not a Mac user, I'm sure a lot of Mac owners would love the cross-platform compatibility that TomeRaider offers. In any case, this is a brazen attempt to get you interested in the TomeRaider format - I'm cc'ing a copy of this mail to Simon at TomeRaider just to draw his attention to the fact that you have the experience and programming skills that TomeRaider would need to extend its reach to Macs and Newtons. It would also be fun to work with you again on a big project like this.I wrote a brief article about TomeRaider which is posted athttp://www.revoworld.com/dbShowNews.asp?ID=412, and there's more information at www.tomeraider.comBest wishes for the New Year, and happy birthday in arrears!Peter(PS: Dagmar and I married on November 8th in Florida, and are now fixing up our new apartment in Vienna.)
