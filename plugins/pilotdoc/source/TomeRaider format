I think all of TomeRaider's features wouldeasily map onto the Newton Bookreader. TR seems to usejust a small subset of standard HTML. Examples:TRML Specification v1.02<new>  The <new> tag is used to delimit between entries in aText import file (It is not used in TAB import files).Examples:<new>Gladiator (Latin, gladius, "sword"). A Professional fighter whoperformed in spectacles of armed combat in ancientRoman circuses and amphitheatres................<a·>  The Anchor element is used to create hyperlinks withina TR file.  TRML hyperlinks are ãinlineä in that theycan only link to other pages(entries) and not to webpages or entries in other TR files. Format:<a:target page>hyperlink text</a>.<b...> The Bold element specifies that the text should berendered in boldface, where available.Format:<b>bold text</b><i...> The Italic element specifies that the text should berendered in italic font, where available. Format:<i>italic text</i><u...> The Underline elements state that the enclosed textshould be rendered underlined. Format:<u>underline text</u>                                    <li> The List element is used to present a list of itemswhich are marked by bullets or numbers depending onwhether the list is defined as an unordered list(<ul>)or an ordered list<ol>.Format:<ol><li> List Item<li>List Item<li>List item</ol><ol><li>First list item<li>Second list item<li>Third list item</ol>                                    <hr> A Horizontal Rule element is a divider betweensections of text. The <hr> tag also forces a linebreak.<br> The Line Break element specifies that a new line mustbe started at the given point. <p> The Paragraph element indicates a new paragraph oftext.                                    <centre>All this text would be centred in thepage</centre> Combining TagsTags are combined by nesting. Thus<b><i>This text is in Bold Itallic</i></b><i><b>This text is in Itallic Bold</b></i>(Ie, Nodifference)<b>This text is all bold but only <u>this part isunderlined.</u></b>As you see, there's nothing in TomeRaider format thatthe Newton Bookreader can't handle.I've encouraged Simon to contact you directly, if onlyto introduce himself and discuss what you think aboutTomeRaider on Newton/Mac environments. He's aware youhave a couple of other pressing projects to finishbefore you have time for an in-depth look atTomeRaider.By the way, congratulations to you and Sean on theport of WABA to Newton! Running Palm apps on theNewton looks pretty entertaining - hope to give it atry later this week.Best regards,Peter                               __________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Yahoo!
