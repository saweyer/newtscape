(this would mean users would still create RichReader docs using desktop tools, but download those .pdb files and convert from RichReader format to HTML)if someone else ports the RTF and/or PDF converters to Newton, I'd be glad to provide a helperApp so when users downloaded .rtf, .pdf files,the helperApp would recognize the MIME type, then send the VBO to the app, to be converted and displayed (presumably in NewtWorks).-- Steve  weyer@kagi.comNewton apps/tools: Newt's Cape, NewtDevEnv, Sloup, Crypto,...  http://www.kagi.com/weyer/
