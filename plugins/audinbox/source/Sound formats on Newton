Subject: Re: Sound formats on NewtonDate: Wed, 8 Mar 00 18:20:36 +0000From: Simon Bell <simple@dial.pipex.com>>Simon, could you possibly explain to me the sound formats SM can currently handle?For an in-depth treatment of sound formats, visit <http://home.sprynet.com/~cbagwell/AudioFormats-11.html>. All the formats below are handled directly by the Newton 2.1 sound interface. All the SM Audio Decoder does is extract the sound data from the binary message and put it into a Newton sound frame that can be played by the Newton 2.1 sound interface. AIFFFile extensions .aiff .aifDeveloped by Apple and others, so predominantly used on Macintosh. SMsupports only 8-bit uncompressed sound samples. There is a compressedformat, file extension .aifc, which will not work with SM's AudioDecoder.WAVFile extensions .wav'Developed' by Microsoft, it differs just enough from AIFF to renderit incompatible but is essentially the same. As for AIFF, SM supportsonly 8-bit uncompressed sound samples.muLawFile extensions .au .snd .ulwThis is a standard compression technique that is often used tocompress voice data. It is the basic MIME audio type (Content-Type:audio/basic).GSMFile extensions .gsm ?This is a standard compression used for cellular phone data. Newton2.1 can encode/decode it but I don't know if/how it's wrapped up forMIME (JFAX) attachments. For example, the other formats allow textinfo: author, comments, etc to be included with the sound. The SM GSMdecoder assumes a GSM attachment is just all GSM data.I hope that isn't too technical,Simon
