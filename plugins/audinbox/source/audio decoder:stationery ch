I tried the same files with my configuration and they worked fine.I noticed that the versions I have of Audio Decoder (2/3/00; size=9744) and Audio Stationery (9/28/99; size=15596) are different from those on your web site.  (btw, the URLs there contain /System/Web Site 4.0/ instead of /simple/ in middle of paths, so I had to do a little editing to download them). AudInbox, my Newt's Cape plugin, just modifies the Inbox entry as follows:  		body.class := 'audio;		body.|MIME:Simple| := {codec: '|WAV:Simple|, info: "WAV Audio"};it fixes up files sent via EETransfer and also directly from web.has anything changed in how you mark or recognize audio items in Inbox?I'm assuming this is likely the problem (though I haven't installed the new versions on my Newton yet to test; I want to make sure I've got backup copies of the old ones first...; and thought it might be faster to ask anyway)if so, let me know what changes, and I could probably make a quick fix to AudInboxSteve
