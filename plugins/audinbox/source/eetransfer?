Newt's Cape itself doesn't get involved in processing the resulting data, so File: Open Inbox shouldn't do anything. (perhaps Newt's Cape could "process" an Inbox entry by doing some cleanup on it, i.e., adding the additional fields and resaving the Inbox entry (and then SimpleMail would recognize it), but I'd have to take a closer look at the feasibility of this).
