It is now very mature and recognized. The compression algorithm it implements is used in zip files (among other compression algorithms) and within software such as VNC or SSH.I have partially ported ZLib 1.1.3 to NewtonOS (1.0 is the version number of the  port). The ZLib Newton Package includes NewtonScript wrappers to basic Inflate/Deflate functions (with calling conventions very similar to the ZLib's conventions).You can find the package for your Newton and the source code as well as the documentation and the user license on my website:http://www.kallisys.com/newton/zlib/The ZLib Newton package is like a shared library and it actually uses the Units mechanism (provided by NewtonOS 2.x). It doesn't do anything once installed without a software using it.The ZLib Newton package is currently used by two softwares by Steve Weyer which he'll release soon (probably today):VNC client 3.3a6 (I don't need to present this software I guess): If you have ZLib installed, the packets sent by the server can be compressed. Requires that the server implements it. Note to fellow MacOS users: there is no MacOS server doing ZLib compression (ChromiVNC offers the option in the prefs but doesn't implement it).UnzipBMP: this is a Newtscape plug-in to display BMP images and browse zip archives. Don't ask me why both features are together, I forgot although it's in the doc, but the thing is that if you have the ZLib package installed, you can extract deflate-compressed files from the zip files.Notes concerning the source code of the original ZLib: the changes I had to do to be compilable for NewtonOS were basically to declare as const every global variable practically used as constants but not declared or partially declared as such. As a consequence, the source code included in the developer archive may not be compilable for other targets.Paul-- Home page: http://www.kallisys.com/Newton-powered WebServer: http://newt.dyndns.org:8080/
