I've just fixed the bug which the Newtscape user experienced (thanks to Newtscape actually, it was easy to reproduce), it's that I didn't do what the system expects me to do with NewWithingTransaction store method. I'm going to see if this fixes the package installation problem as well and I'll work on porting the ZLib.>I'd assume initially an API along lines of what I had proposed earlier>(outputVBO, outputoffset, outputlen, inputVBO, inputOffset, inputLen).Actually, I think I'm going to simply follow the ZLib APIs plus the MiniZip APIs. Cf zlib/contrib/minizip/unzip.h (well, I attached the file). Unless you think that something else would better suit your needs. The idea here is that I might one day get this port of the zlib be included into the official zlib version (with my changes concerning global variables).>another issue is what to do for different file result extensions since>there's no general Newton mechanism for file associations; initially,>probably just handle a few obvious extensions like .pkg, .txt, .pdb, etc.>that Newt's Cape already knows how to dispatch (using its MIME type>helperApps), but that could be extended later by me or someone else (my>plugin would be free/open source).Yup, this is an issue of a user interface.Paul-- Home page: http://www.kallisys.com/Newton-powered WebServer: http://newt.dyndns.org:8080/
