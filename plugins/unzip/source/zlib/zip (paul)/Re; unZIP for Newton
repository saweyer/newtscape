I already have NS code that parses the .zip file and finds individual entries, but it only extracts uncompressed entries.  all I'd need would be a function (same args as BinaryMunger), where I could pass in something like:unzip(uncompressedBinary,0,Length(uncompressedBinary), compressedBinary,offset,count) );where the binaries would usually be VBOs if they're big;count arg could be nil which would mean length(binary)if this worked, then I'd just need to write a little code that displayed an overview of filenames so user could select which they wanted to extract,and a little prefs view that set destination/helper for each file extension. many of these would correspond to existing Newt's Cape helpers, but I'd also include a few default ones (like Inbox, Notepad, NewtWorks, plus let user set for any they know about). thanks-- Steve
