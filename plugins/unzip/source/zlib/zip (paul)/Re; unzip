To: Paul Guyot <pguyot@kallisys.net>Subject: Re: unzipI've written a plugin that opens a .zip (or .jar) file, displays overview with checkboxes, individual filenames and info -- full size, modified date; if compressed, the format and compressed size; and MIME type, if known.  it infers the MIME type from the file extension and current list of Newt's Cape helper apps; of course, someone else could write a custom panel to specify mappings and a different dispatch mechanism.select one or more files; Extractso far, I've only tested on items whose compression format = STORED (= 0, i.e., uncompressed); for DEFLATED (=8) or other formats, it currently generates an error.  I've only tested with file extensions: .txt, .htm,/.html, .bmp/.wbmall of which display via Newt's Cape(for text, plugin expands from 8-bit to unicode, and converts lf to cr.)(the plugin includes BMP conversion code from WabaTester)next, I'll try a few extensions that map to other helperApps:  .pkg, .pdb (for PilotDoc), .wav (AudInbox), etc.let me know when you've got some unzip code to handle compressed files that you'd like me to try...Steve
