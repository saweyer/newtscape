There are four files:* NSandDDKIncludes.h* Objects_m.h* UserGlobals_m.h* UserTasks_m.hwhich are in the Gestalt sample code until I make an update of the NewtonDevpackage. The makefile for this project expects them to be in a folder calledNSandDDK in your NCT folder (next to the Includes and DDKIncludes folders).If you have any trouble, don't hesitate to contact me.## =========================================================================== #### Many of the convicted thieves Parker has met began their                    #### life of crime after taking college Computer Science courses.                ####                 -- Roger Rapoport, "Programs for Plunder", Omni, March 1981 #### =========================================================================== ##
