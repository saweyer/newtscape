ZLib for NewtonOS is based on ZLib by Jean-Loup Gailly and Mark Adler whichhas the following license:  zlib.h -- interface of the 'zlib' general purpose compression library  version 1.1.3, July 9th, 1998  Copyright (C) 1995-1998 Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler  This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied  warranty.  In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages  arising from the use of this software.  Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,  including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it  freely, subject to the following restrictions:  1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not     claim that you wrote the original software. If you use this software     in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be     appreciated but is not required.  2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be     misrepresented as being the original software.  3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution.  Jean-loup Gailly        Mark Adler  jloup@gzip.org          madler@alumni.caltech.edu  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs (Request for  Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1950.txt  (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format).Additionally, I added the following restrictions for the changes and the codeI'm the author of:  1. The ZLib package in its released form shall not be included into another  package.  2. Any redistribution of a modified version of the ZLib package without my  agreement shall not include "Kallisys", including as a signature and for  the DeclareUnit and DefineUnit parameters.I realize that the ZLib license loses its Open Source certification from theOSI with my addenda. If it's a problem, just submit them to the OSI. I don'tthink they violate the Open Source definition.
