It is used in thousands of software.This update is only a bug/security fix. In other words, ZLib for NewtonOS 1.1 includes ZLib 1.1.4 instead of 1.1.3. The APIs didn't change, and this release is fully compatible with the previous one, except that it now says 1.1.4 for the version.The ZLib for NewtonOS can be found on my website:http://www.kallisys.com/newton/zlib/
