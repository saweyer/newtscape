I hope they didn't shut it down! There must be mirrors aroundtoo, though. I did try a yahoo search of MOD MUSIC and got quite a fewhits.try http://www.alpha64.org/ for a site with some mods (some zipped) and players as-well.My player only works with .MOD files, (not .XM or .S3M, which are alsooften referred to as mod, but are newer formats. I'll support themonly if I get huge response, but that's unlikely to happen.) I'drather fix the bugs in the existing player's effects first.Yea, a vbo's fine. I can use that, but I have to add to the player theability to accept mods by ref, as opposed to by symbol/slot.I've posted about 5 example mods already in pkg format on my site too. RogerSteve Weyer wrote:>>Playing a .mod file with my player is a matter of getting a binary image of the>>.mod into the newton somewhere/somehow, as a binary object.
