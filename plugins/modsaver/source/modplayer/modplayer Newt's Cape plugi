I had even saved some of our earlier messages with code snippets. I assume I'd use the AutoPlayWithCallback method. is it necessary to supply a callback function? the plugin itself doesn't hang onto a reference to the VBO, so if your app doesn't either, then it would just automatically get gc-ed when no one refers to it. (in the meanwhile, I could supply a callback fn that does nothing) I just downloaded the latest 2.0b1 version from your site http://roger.trideja.com/newton/newton.html and will take a look at this a little later today. if it works, next step I might imagine is to have an option to save the VBO in a soup so that user could play it again later. do you have a provision for displaying/selecting from a list of currently installed songs (from packages)? if so, it might be relatively easy to have it look in a special Modplayer soup, with entries like {name: "song name", song: <VBO>}. then my plugin could just save the song there, then your player could allow user to later select/play it. (otherwise, the plugin would just play it once directly)
