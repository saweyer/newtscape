So far, I've been just building a .pkg out of it using the NTKand creating a slot in the root view and doing a LoadDataFile() -- thePC version of LoadResource, or something like that?Once you have the binaryObject (in this case, embeded in a .pkg, soit's not in your heap), take it and pass the symbol of the package andthe name of the slot to the AutoPlay() function in my modPlayer app.It should be easy to hook it into newts cape. I wrote up a bit of atutorial at my site which describes how to make a .mod into a .pkg toupload it to the newton. If newtscape can make a .pkg too (I think itcan?), it just needs to know the special-case slots to add to make amod into a package and have it recognised by the player.Make sure you check out the modplayer stuff I've written up at (a bitof technical stuff too) athttp://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Code/5100/modplayer.html Let me know if you want to work on that! I'll help, if you want me to,but I don't have access to the net through my newton.You may want additional features added to the player, like a callbackwhen the mod is done, so you can free-up the object? Also, specifyingthe mod to play directly, rather than through a package symbol andslot name would be nicer too, I suppose. What do you think?Wav files would be extremely simple to play. I want to solve thecallback problem I'm having first though, because if that's notsolved, it's really annoying to have the sound die when you touch thenewton screen sometimes, or if any other app is running in thebackground and is not idle at the time. (Even a low-battery pop-upwill kill the callback!)RogerSteve Weyer wrote:>In article <36F2376E.D92A794B@barking-dog.com>, Roger Milne <roger@barking-dog.com> wrote:>>I have recently written a .MOD file player for the newton (a music format which dates back to the days of the Amiga/Atari) -- see below for the web-site. >do you convert a .mod file on desktop, then bundle it into a package? or does your Newton app also convert .mod format? >if so (and there are .mod files available on the web), it would be straightforward/neat to set up ModPlayer as a helperApp (for Newt's Cape) that could convert and then play a .mod file directly. >also, have you looked at converting/playing .wav files? >Steve weyer@kagi.com>NewtDevEnv, Newt's Cape, Sloup, Crypto,... http://members.bellatlantic.net/~sweyer/newton/index.htm http://www.kagi.com/weyer/
