If I wanted to handle the display myself, I couldcreate a viewer. And I suppose a stasher for separately caching object.What I'd really like to do is register for "image/jpeg", get the rawbyte stream, convert it to Newton format, then hand it to NetHopper tocache/display -- could NH basically treat it as an already-convertedGIF, i.e., 1) cache converted result for future use; 2) display it as itwould a converted GIF. (that way I wouldn't have to deal with viewers,stashers, which seem pretty redundant to me since NH can already handleimages).how possible/easy is this?what're you up to these days -- still with Spyglass? Thanks
