Has anyone ever finished writing the necessary plug-in for Nethopper that allows you to view JPEG images on the Newton?

Thanks in advance for the feedback.>David Deranianhi David,the quickest solution is to install Newt's Cape ;-) your original post did catch my attention though and got me thinking. if there were enough NetHopper users out there who don't want to change browsers (due to happiness with interface, other functionality, inertia, cost barriers, etc.), but might be willing to spend, say $10 for a JPEG plugin. I'd consider creating a separate version of our Newt's Cape JPEG plugin to work with NetHopper. (I looked at the NetHopper API docs briefly; getting/converting the JPEG wouldn't be difficult; but having NH display and cache the graphic (as though it were a converted GIF) is not so obvious; I'm awaiting a reply from someone from the original NH team; but if some other developer out there has done NH plugins and can offer some advice, I'll be more likely to consider this).
