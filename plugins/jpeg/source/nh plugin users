I use NetHopper not because it is better. I'mjust used to it's simple interface. Newt's Cape has the best featureset. I know there would be many others who would pay for the NetHopperplug in. John B.

I have been happy with NH working withWebXpress but I envy those using other browsers everytime I fail todownload an image because its jpg.----<Laurent_Daudelin@fanniemae.com>I would be more than happy to pay $10 to get this functionality in  NetHopper. I used to get a message from one of the original NH team member  that also sent me an example of plug-in and a document describing the API. If  you think that this would be useful, let me know. I've considered some time  ago writing that plugin, but I've never wrote any extension in NewtonScript  (only app), and I was lacking the time to do it. If I had a mentor like you,  providing me answers to problems/questions, maybe I would reconsider writing  it.-Laurent.=====================================================================Laurent DaudelinDeveloper, Object Factory, Substrate                       Fannie MaePhone: 202-752-3987             mailto:Laurent_Daudelin@fanniemae.comFax:   202-752-4207                           Usual disclaimers apply----"Mike O'Brien" <obrien@rush.aero.org>	Someone said you were testing the waters to see who wouldpay $10 for a JPEG plug-in for Nethopper.	Well, I sure would!----I'd gladly pay $10 for a Newtscape Jpeg plug-in!Doug Yuilldyuill@nortel.ca----Scott Thomsen <scottt@texas.net>I have been silently watching the NHjpeg thread.
