Does anyone have access to such a JPEG converter that we could pass on to Steve? That would bring about a significant improvement in the Newton's browsing capabilities. ><What format should a program be in? I'm a Windows user and I use JASC's Paint Shop Pro and Lview Pro for converting my GIFs to JPGs>. >I don't know! I don't understand the technical aspects of programming at all. I'll forward your reply to Steve for further details. the plugin would convert JPEG to Newton bitmap or PICT format. this would be a Newton autopart(extension) written in C++ compatible with the NTK toolkit (though it's possible it could be written as optimized NewtonScript with the NATIVE keyword). I think there is public/free JPEG C conversion code available, but the main problems would be: 1) adding support for Newton graphic format 2) converting to Apple's C++ version (and limitations, e.g., globals) 3) writing as autopart so it can be accessible from other apps 4) integration with Newt's Capeideally, it would have already gone thru some basic testing; I'd be glad to provide further testing, advice on (3), and do the Newt's Cape integration (4). but I don't have the time (or graphics/C++ skills) to do 1 & 2. as I mentioned elsewhere, another developer had done much of 1&2 and was willing to share the plugin; but he started to update the code to latest public version and then got too busy with other projects. one possibility is that if he's never going to finish it, he'd be willing to share the code he's got so far so someone wouldn't have to start over.
