I wonder if it'd be possible to rework our JPEG plugin for NetHopper, esp. if it involves just a different NewtonScript wrapper (same C code). since my guess is there are large number of NH users out there who don't want to change, but maybe they'd be willing to spend $10 for a plugin. (public version would expire after 30 days). maybe I'll take a look at the NH API docs. what do you think?]-----From: David Deranian <deranian@worldnet.att.net> Subject: Ntlk JPEG plug-in for Nethopper? Hello everyone!I realize this is probably a dead issue since Nethopper is no longer = supported, but I need to ask the following. Has anyone ever finished = writing the necessary plug-in for Nethopper that allows you to view JPEG = images on the Newton? If not, should I assume that the only way to get = this feature is to delete Nethopper and install NewtScape instead? Thanks = in advance for the feedback.
