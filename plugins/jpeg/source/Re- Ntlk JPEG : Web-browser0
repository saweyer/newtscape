You replied regarding the same plug-in for Newt's Cape??? Anyway, I've been pretty busy with a new full time job, and a personal project for the Newton during evening (night!), so I still haven't started looking at the work involved to write that plug-in, autopart. So, after reading some messages regarding this autopart for Newt's Cape, and after reading that a guy did already some work, I thought I would maybe step in. I've been using a Newton since the OMP, did write a small app at this time, am now owner of an MP2100, and, as I said, started some time ago writing a 2.0 package. I've been programming on NEXTSTEP for 5 years now, so I'm pretty comfortable with OO programming and design. I still need to get up to speed with NewtonScript. I've got all the documentation, samples, the C++ tools, Newton Programming using Macintosh, so I have pretty much everything needed. So, I have a family and can't promise anything, except some evenings every week, but I would be willing to see what I could do, and put my personal project on hold for some time. I would like to know what you think, and what kind of support I could expect from you and the guy that started writing the plug-in. Thanks in advance!-Laurent.===================================================================== Laurent Daudelin	Fannie MaePhone: 202-752-3987	mailto:Laurent_Daudelin@fanniemae.comFax: 202-752-4207	Usual disclaimers apply
